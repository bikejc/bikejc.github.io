We recently started an annual fall art-themed bike tour in conjunction with the citywide Jersey City Art &amp; Studio Tour\n\nWe also put on various smaller, informal rides that take us on two wheels to have fun, see the sights, and socialize. And we pitch in with other sustainable, people-oriented events like neighborhood cleanups and community gardening.\n\nJoin us!\n"})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[9777,3706,9774,2888,179],(function(){return n=4735,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
