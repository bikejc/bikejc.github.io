Artists all over the city open their studios to thousands of visitors, special shows are mounted at galleries, there are music and theater events and galas\u2015it\u2019s a citywide arts buffet, with traditional and unconventional DIY venues all over the place, and official and unofficial parties and performances stretching into the wee hours.\n\nStarting in 2014, we began offering bike tours on both full days of the festival, leading art-lovers on two wheels around some of the festival\u2019s great venues. The tours are led by some of the same marshals who guide our big spring Ward Tour. But the pace is even mellower, with time to enjoy the art at every stop. We focus on some of the more far-flung venues that you might not get to on foot\u2015including some of our city\u2019s growing collection of outdoor murals, which are lots of fun to explore by bike! Note: Flamboyant decoration of both bikes and riders is encouraged!\n\nBike JC runs the BIKEJCAST tours in coordination with the Jersey City Office of Cultural Affairs (and the grace of the many artists involved). In future editions, we plan to work with them even more closely, to bring you more formal previews and maps of the venues on our routes in advance, and promote them to an even wider audience.\n\nJoin us and get your art on!\n"})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[9777,3706,9774,2888,179],(function(){return t=1933,e(e.s=t);var t}));var t=e.O();_N_E=t}]);
