City agencies provided all the equipment, including a waste container, rolling garbage cans, rakes, shovels, and garbage bags, which made this community event feasible on such a grand scale. The huge success of this event will continue and spread to other neighborhoods throughout the spring and summer.\n\nOur goal is to partner with other community groups to create an annual Earth Day event where all neighborhoods receive the assistance to clean up and beautify all of Jersey City.\n"})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[9777,3706,9774,2888,179],(function(){return n=2905,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
