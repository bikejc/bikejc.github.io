We are\ncommitted to working with our neighborhoods, schools, and elected officials to make Jersey City the\nmost bike-friendly city in the state. We want to help bicyclists commute, exercise, enjoy scenic\nrides, ferry children to school and activities, and head out shopping in increasing numbers in the\nimmediate future.\n\nWe believe a bike-friendly city is safer for everyone. Studies have shown that the mere presence of\nmore bicyclists (and pedestrians) encourages motorists to drive with more caution and decreases\ncrashes. Bicycle lanes not only tend to increase the number of cyclists but can act as a traffic\ncalming measure, helping pedestrians navigate streets safely as well. Bicycling is also economical,\neasy on the environment, and transforms the average commute into a great workout.\n\n![](/files/light-up-ride-city-hall.jpg)\n'})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[9777,3706,9774,2888,179],(function(){return t=5301,e(e.s=t);var t}));var t=e.O();_N_E=t}]);
