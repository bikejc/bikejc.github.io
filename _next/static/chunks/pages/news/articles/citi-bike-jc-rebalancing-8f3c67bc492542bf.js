As with earlier removals in the northern Heights, the latest\nrealignment is unfortunate and painful for several reasons.\n\nSome of the stations had groups of regular users who are now deprived of service. And several of the\nstations served or are in or near, underserved communities, and neighborhoods with many lower-income\nresidents, which raises the serious concern that this rebalance will exacerbate the already\ndocumented [equity gap in bike share systems.](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/07/what-keeps-bike-share-white/533412/)\n\nCiti Bike JC\u2019s operators, Motivate, are moving eight of its least-used stations to areas where other\nstations are already heavily used. We have no doubt this will improve service within those areas,\nwill let Motivate re-balance the bikes between stations with less delay and expense, and will\nencourage more people in those areas to buy memberships, keeping the company financially sound\u2014and\nhopefully, over time, allowing it to expand again into a wider area.\n\nThis is now very similar to the model of the affiliated Citi Bike NYC, which serves something like\n20% of the land area of New York City, including its densest and most transit-friendly areas and,\nrecently, including large communities of color such as Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant. It also leaves\n80% of NYC without bike share. We believe Motivate when they say that that model is the only way\nthey can operate in a self-sustainable way over time under its current conditions.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t all continue to try for something better. We believe everyone in\nJersey City should have access to high-quality bike share. It\u2019s a small enough place that we should\nbe able to support it even in the far north and south.\n\nSo we call on the city government, Motivate, and our residents and community organizations to work\ntogether, and explore several possibilities:\n\n**Public or private subsidy for Citi Bike JC**\n\u2013 We all subsidize various forms of mass transit, including trains and buses, through our taxes,\ntolls, and other payments. Why should bike share be any different? It improves safety and health,\nmoves people efficiently, and is more equitable than expensive car travel\u2014if we make it accessible\nto everyone. The city should fund Citi Bike JC sufficiently to allow it to expand throughout the\ncity; there may be public or private grants available for the same purpose.\n\n**Better discount programs**\n\u2013 JC Housing Authority residents are already eligible for discounted $5 monthly membership. But\nuptake is slow (as it is in NYC), due in part to a lack of awareness and difficulties for people\nwithout credit cards. We should do more to promote, expand, and improve these discount programs.\n\n**Dockless bike share**\n\u2013 Using shared bikes that can be parked without docks, dockless bike share, has sometimes been\ncriticized as untidy, but it also is gaining a reputation for serving low-income communities and\nless-dense urban areas effectively. Several competing companies are offering dockless bike share\n\nnow, and Motivate is reportedly testing its own version. Some cities now host both docked and\ndockless bike share; Jersey City could be one of those cities.\n\n**Government and business employees on bike share**\n\u2014 The city government should replace some of its use of cars with bike share for short trips; this\nwould save taxpayer dollars. Both government and local business should offer no-cost or deeply\nsubsidized Citi Bike JC memberships for all employees as a matter of course, as an employee benefit.\nAll these measures would get more people biking in safer streets and pump money into the system.\n\n**Business and developer sponsorship of stations**\n\u2013 Citi Bike JC accepts sponsorships for docking stations to be located near a particular business or\nresidential development, for the benefit of its employees or residents, and the station is then also\navailable to everyone else. Encouraging more of these\u2014perhaps during the approval process for new\ndevelopment\u2014could help spread and support bike share.\n\n**Protected bike network**\n\u2013 Some of it is already being planned, but it\u2019s essential that the city build out a complete network\nof protected bike lanes and other bikeable streets and pathways if bike share is to reach its full\npotential in Jersey City. Membership in NYC has already benefited from the miles of protected lanes\nthere.\n[Study](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2017/07/05/whats-keeping-people-from-using-bike-share-new-study-breaks-it-down-by-race-and-income/) after\n[study](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2017/04/18/for-people-of-color-barriers-to-biking-go-far-beyond-infrastructure-study-shows/)\nshows that traffic safety is the top concern for cyclists and non-cyclists and that protected bike\nlanes, once installed, are\n[safe, effective, and popular](https://peopleforbikes.org/our-work/statistics/statistics-category/?cat=protected-bike-lane-statistics).\n\n![Photo of Citi Bike dock with a bikelane in the foreground](../../files/IMG_ixo4t3%20(1).jpg)\n"})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[9777,3706,9774,2888,179],(function(){return t=6470,e(e.s=t);var t}));var t=e.O();_N_E=t}]);
