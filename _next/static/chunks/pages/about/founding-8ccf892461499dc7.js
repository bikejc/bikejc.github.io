Plenty of folks\nwere talking about the need for a group to provide a voice for bicyclist and pedestrian\nconcerns. Prompted by Civic JC organizer Dan Levin, they came together the first time in\nDecember 2009 at a local pub for first meeting of what would become Bike JC; they included\nrepresentatives of Grove Street Bicycles, Rodney Morweiser and Mike Wilson; owners of bike\ncompany Easy Riders, Christopher Englese and Damian Wieczorek; and community members Carly\nBerwick, Kris Reiss, Andres Palmiter, Mike Selender, and others. The group quickly set the\ntemplate for what would become its mission and method: horizontal decision-making guiding by\nstrong principles of inclusiveness, access, safety, environmental stewardship, and low-cost\ntransit for all.\n\nAll hands joined to volunteer and build a group that would quickly decide a name, design a logo\nand look, launch a web site and secure social media handles --both coordinated by founding board\nmember Andres Palmiter--and elect a board and first president, Carly Berwick.\n\nThroughout the first months, in spring 2010, the group worked with the city and Hudson TMA to add\nbike racks to Journal Square, to organize Bike to Work Week, and to stage the first Ward Tour,\nled by Englese and Wieczorek. Organizers expected 50-100 riders to show: nearly 500 arrived.\nAside from being a fun time, the Ward Tour allowed the greater public to see the strength of the\nlocal cycling community. In 2015 more than 1500 people rode--that's a lot of empowered community\nmembers and voters.\n\nDuring this first year Bike JC also worked with the City of Jersey City, particularly Doug\nGreenfeld and the Mayors Office, culminating with the city painting the first bike lane along\nGrove Street, and releasing a comprehensive bike plan.\n\nAlong with Bike JC, the citizens of Jersey City have supported a growing bike culture through key\nallies including:\n- The East Coast Greenway Alliance, which put in bicycle signage throughout Jersey City in\n2008\n- The Hudson County Transportation Management Association -City of Jersey City, which\nimplemented bike route signage and a network of bike lanes\n- Local bike shops Grove Street Bicycles, Jersey Cycles, and the Bike Hub Bike\nJC\u2019s annual events also include the Community Garden Bike Tour and the BikeJCAST. Equally\ncritical to our mission is our ongoing support for expanded and connected bike lanes, traffic\ncalming, public information about safe cycling, and dedicated bike lanes throughout the\ncity.\n"})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[9777,3706,9774,2888,179],(function(){return n=9340,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
