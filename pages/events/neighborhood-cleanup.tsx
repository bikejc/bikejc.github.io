                Bike JC partnered up with RSVP of Hudson County, Morris Canal CDC, Home Depot, Nu Bar &amp; Restaurant, Department of Public Works, JCIA, and the Stop the Drop campaign to clean up the Lafayette section of Jersey City on Sunday, April 26th.

                This public/private partnership assembled over 50 volunteers, who came out to collect about 20 cubic yards of garbage. City agencies provided all the equipment, including a waste container, rolling garbage cans, rakes, shovels, and garbage bags, which made this community event feasible on such a grand scale. The huge success of this event will continue and spread to other neighborhoods throughout the spring and summer.

                Our goal is to partner with other community groups to create an annual Earth Day event where all neighborhoods receive the assistance to clean up and beautify all of Jersey City.
