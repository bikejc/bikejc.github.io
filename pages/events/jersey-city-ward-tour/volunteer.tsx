[Rider registration is now open](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jersey-city-ward-tour-2022-tickets-324066169637) for this year's 11th Annual Ward Tour, rolling on **Sunday, June 5, 2022**. We are in need of volunteers both leading up to the event and on the day of the tour. We canâ€™t do it without you!

### SHORT VERSION
We need volunteers to help with many tasks leading up to the event and on the day of the tour, including:
- **Promoting the event**: putting up posters around the city, handing out palm cards, staffing tables at local events, etc.
- **Starting line (8am-12pm):** registration/merch tables, misc setup
- **During the ride (11am-2pm):** marshaling, wayfinding, SAG (Support And Gear)
- **Finish line (2pm-7pm):** monitoring bike parking area, misc cleanup/teardown 

In addition, we will be organizing bib pickups the day before the ride (Saturday, June 4), at various locations around Jersey City, and will need help organizing that process.

Many of our regular volunteers already know the Ward Tour drill from previous years. Please just save the date if you can work the event June 5, and know that we will soon schedule at least one meeting for volunteers to go over details and hand out whatever posters, postcards, and other promotional materials we have on hand, so you can help distribute them if you can.

**Please [sign up here](https://forms.gle/oPshTHx44md5CBCH7) if you are interested in helping, and we'll be in touch to schedule a volunteers meeting in mid- to late-May.**

## VOLUNTEER NEEDS

### Before the Tour

#### Promoting
Leading up to the event, we need people to help promote the event:
- putting up posters around the city
- handing out palm cards
- staffing our tables at local events like Groove on Grove
- etc.

#### Bib pickup day (Saturday, June 4)
We'll have bibs available for riders to pick up at various locations around Jersey City the day before the event, and we'll need help organizing and staffing those locations.

### Day of the Tour

Day-of roles that we need to fill are for setup of the start area and the festival finish area, rider registration, ride marshals, and staffing various booths and tables at the start and finish.

#### Setup
Morning setup starts at **8 a.m. at City Hall** ([280 Grove St., at Montgomery Street](https://goo.gl/maps/tMHCxVZU4Q3qBGvc8)) and involves some heavy lifting and the ability to work fast.

#### Registration
Morning pre-ride registration involves sitting at a table outside City Hall on the day of the event, and collecting completed registration forms, checking in pre-registered riders, and distributing numbered ride bibs. **Registration starts at 9:00 a.m.**

#### Marshaling
Marshals ride in strategic places within the tour, helping to direct other riders and keep them safe, help them with minor mechanical and other issues, communicate with police, and generally make the ride work smoothly. Marshals should show up at City Hall in time to attend a briefing around 10:30 a.m. along the south side of City Hall.

#### Festival Setup
Setup workers will work in and around the finish-line / [Jazz Festival](https://riverviewjazz.org/jersey-city-jazz-festival) **from about 12-2pm**, while the riders are out on the tour. You will help set up the festival grounds. You will need to work quickly, follow a map/site plan for the festival, possibly do some lifting, and take initiative.

**NOTE:** THESE VOLUNTEERS CANNOT RIDE IN THE TOUR. If you are a friend of biking, but you can't or don't want to ride in the tour, please consider volunteering for this duty.

#### Finish Festival Staff
Staff work begins later in the day in or around the finish line / [Jazz Festival](https://riverviewjazz.org/jersey-city-jazz-festival) ([107 Morgan St.](https://goo.gl/maps/YLfwHwet3ATYxVc79)), and involves staffing the t-shirt sales tables, monitoring the bike parking area, directing crowd flow, etc. We also need a few people to do similar jobs at the start at City Hall before the ride. The start and finish sites are only 5 minutes' walk from each other, so you could work at both sites.

All communication will be handled via email. Volunteers will be asked to sign a waiver form at event sites.

Thanks again for helping us make this an amazing annual event!
