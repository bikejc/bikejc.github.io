                    TO REGISTER:
                </p>
                <p>
                    FIRST: Check out detailed information about the Ward Tour on the main page
                    <a href="/events/jersey-city-ward-tour">
                        HERE
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    SECOND: Read the legal waiver below. Registering means you agree to all its conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    THIRD: Sign up yourself and each minor under your supervision, including volunteers, for only ONE of the two routes available, the 15-mile route within Jersey City, or the special 25-mile route that includes parts of Bayonne and Hoboken. You MUST meet the conditions listed for whichever route you choose.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        REGISTER FOR THE 15-MILE ROUTE
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        All riders on the main 15-mile route MUST also be able to maintain a pace of approximately 10 mph.
                    </strong>
                    This is a fairly relaxed pace for an adult who bikes even occasionally. We also take some short breaks to catch a breath and to allow for smooth traffic control, and our one long break in Lincoln Park roughly at the halfway point, after the only steep uphill on the course (so you can just walk your bike up that hill if you want).

                    <strong>
                        ll riders on the 25-mile route MUST be able to maintain a somewhat faster pace, about 12 mph, obviously for longer, and must be ready to roll with fewer and shorter rest breaks.
                    </strong>
                    This is a new, one-time, more complex route that we are offering to celebrate our 10th Ward Tour and showcase the growing bike communities in our neighboring towns.
                    <strong>
                        But we will be especially strict about who does this route, for safety and logistics reasons.
