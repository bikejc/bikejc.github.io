                We believe biking is here to stay in Jersey City. To support and advance it, our mission is to promote and help to create bike infrastructure and other lasting improvements that change the landscape—sometimes literally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our years of advocating for extensive bike lanes helped lead to the city’s current set, the largest in New Jersey, and we helped lead a design contest and a subsequent online crowdfunding drive that brought hundreds of new public bike racks to the streets of the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                We continue to design, support, and agitate for initiatives that make Jersey City and the surrounding areas a safer, healthier, environment for bicyclists.
