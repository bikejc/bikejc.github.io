export const difficultyMd = `[The route](/ward-tour/#route) is about 15 miles long. The riding pace is conversational. Most of of the course is slightly rolling to flat. However, there are a few steady uphill sections, and one steeper but very short hill in Lincoln Park just before the halfway rest point where the ride takes a short water and shade break. People with a wide range of athletic abilities should be able to complete this course.

We’ll ride on streets (or sometimes on one side of a street) that are closed to motor-vehicle traffic by the Jersey City Police Department. Police officers will escort us throughout the ride.

- Arrives 10:22am at Hoboken 14th St.
- [4mi ride to Ward Tour start](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39648414)

**NOTE! This is not the NYC Ferry!** You need the **NY Waterway** app, and it costs $8-$9 (plus a $1.50 bike pass)

### I'll need to drive to the event. Is there parking available? <a id="driving"></a>

We suggest public transportation to the start. There are a few parking lots near the start at City Hall where you could park as well.

### How much does it cost to ride in the Ward Tour? <a id="cost"></a>

- General admission Ward Tour tickets cost $10
- Riders under 18 are free, and over 60 are $5

Bike JC is a 100% volunteer organization, and hosting the Ward Tour costs a significant amount of money. Proceeds from ticket sales also fund our year-round advocacy work (including our many other events, which are all free).

### What should I bring with me? <a id="gear"></a>

Some suggestions: sunglasses, a water bottle, a hat if you'd like to keep the sun/rain off your head, a snack, a light-weight lock if you have one (we will have a supervised bike parking area at the finish line), and a small amount of cash for refreshments from the vendors at the finish. If you plan on purchasing alcohol at the festival please remember to bring a valid ID.

### The A B C Quick Check <a id="abcs"></a>
Before riding, do an ABC quick check ([c/o The League of American Bicyclists](https://www.pedbikeinfo.org/bicyclesaferjourney/abcquickcheck.pdf)):

#### **A** is for **Air**
Check the air pressure, spin the wheels and make sure the tires are not worn out.

#### **B** is for **Brakes**
Check to make sure coaster brakes will stop the bike by spinning the back wheel and applying the brake. If the bike has hand brakes check to see that the levers don’t hit the handlebars when squeezed. Lift one tire up at a time and spin it; squeeze the levers to see if the tire stops. The brake pads should be clean, straight and contact the rims properly. 

#### **C** is for **Cranks, Chain, and Cogs**
Grab the crank arms and try to wiggle side to side. There should be no movement. Spin the pedals and cranks to see if the chain drives the rear wheel. The chain should look like metal not rust or black gunk. If the bike has gears check to make sure the gear levers and derailleurs (gear-changing mechanism) work to shift the chain between gears. 

### Is there a place for me to store a bag or backpack while I ride? <a id="baggage"></a>

Due to the large number of participants, we can't provide this service this year. Please consider packing lightly so that you can carry whatever you bring with you on the ride.

### Are people from outside of Jersey City allowed to participate? <a id="visitors"></a>

Of course! We love introducing more people to all of the interesting, diverse, lively, and historic neighborhoods of Jersey City.

### Am I required to wear a helmet? <a id="helmets"></a>

New Jersey State law requires anyone under the age of 17 to wear a bicycle helmet. In addition we ask all participants over 17 years of age to also wear a helmet. Please contact us with questions or concerns in the event that you are over 17 and the helmet requirement would rule out your ability to participate due to financial and/or religious factors. We would like everyone to be able to participate so we will try to work with you to make sure you or your group are able to ride in the tour.

### What is the age limit for riders? <a id="ages"></a>

There is no age limit for riding in the Ward Tour, but riders should be able to maintain a pace of approximately 8 mph. This is a fairly relaxed pace for an adult who bikes even occasionally. We also take some short breaks to catch a breath and to allow for smooth traffic control, and our one long break in Lincoln Park roughly at the halfway point, after the only steep uphill on the course (so you can just walk your bike up that hill if you want).

### Are the roads closed to traffic? <a id="road-closures"></a>

Yes, the route has rolling closures which means that traffic is not allowed on the road until the riders pass.

### How challenging is the course? Are there a lot of hills? <a id="difficulty"></a>

${difficultyMd}

### What if I am unable to complete the ride? <a id="bailing"></a>

If you run into mechanical issues on the course, we'll have bike mechanics along the route to help fix minor problems so that you can continue on the ride.

In the event you feel unwell or sustain an injury, Jersey City Medical Center will be providing the ride with EMTs on bicycles in addition to a rescue wagon, and can treat you immediately as well as help you determine whether it's safe for you to continue on.

### What if I don't have a bike to ride? <a id="rentals"></a>

<!--### Is there same-day registration? <a id="day-of-registration"></a>-->

<!--There is limited morning-of registration. If you are unable to [register online](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jersey-city-ward-tour-2022-tickets-324066169637) for some reason, please be sure to show up at 9:00 since the lines for anyone who hasn't registered online can become very long, and we don't want you to miss the start of the tour!-->

<!--Since the tour is free, and run by a volunteer staff, we ask everyone to please [register online](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jersey-city-ward-tour-2022-tickets-324066169637) instead if at all possible, since it cuts down on the amount of work volunteers need to do in a very short time frame at the start of the ride.-->

### I noticed there's no rain date. If it's raining does that automatically mean the event will be canceled? <a id="rain-or-shine"></a>

No! The Ward Tour is officially rain-or-shine. It will still be held the event of rain, unless there are safety issues such as lightning storms, very high winds, hail, etc. If the weather is severe enough that the tour absolutely must be canceled we will alert riders via email and on social media asap.
