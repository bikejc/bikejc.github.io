Bike JC is a citizen-based non-profit advocacy organization that aims to make Jersey City streets
safe and welcoming for bicyclists, by promoting bicycle lane creation, additional bicycle rack
placement, education, and group rides.

We are bicyclists, commuters, parents, and advocates for the full potential of Jersey City. We are
committed to working with our neighborhoods, schools, and elected officials to make Jersey City the
most bike-friendly city in the state. We want to help bicyclists commute, exercise, enjoy scenic
rides, ferry children to school and activities, and head out shopping in increasing numbers in the
immediate future.

We believe a bike-friendly city is safer for everyone. Studies have shown that the mere presence of
more bicyclists (and pedestrians) encourages motorists to drive with more caution and decreases
crashes. Bicycle lanes not only tend to increase the number of cyclists but can act as a traffic
calming measure, helping pedestrians navigate streets safely as well. Bicycling is also economical,
easy on the environment, and transforms the average commute into a great workout.
