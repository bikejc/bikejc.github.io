                Motor vehicular, cycling and pedestrian traffic has dramatically increased in Jersey City over the last few years, particularly on Grand Street. As Bike JC looks to expand upon the existing bike-lane network, we understand the need to install protected bike lanes on our busiest roads. Bike JC's vision begins with Grand Street.

                Grand Street runs through several neighborhoods and serves as a connection to major routes and highways. Grand Street also borders the entrance to Liberty State Park for many Jersey City residents and is lined with multiple schools, community centers, houses of worship, commercial and residential districts and the Jersey City Medical Center. Protected bike lanes have proven to be the best tool for encouraging an increase in cycling among the majority of people who are interested in getting around by bike but are concerned about safety.

We ask that residents, businesses, schools, houses of worship and the representatives of Jersey City join in our vision and support the creation of Jersey City's first protected bike lane on Grand Street.
