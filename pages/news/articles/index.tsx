                                        Bike JC is very sorry to see that Citi Bike JC docking stations are being relocated from large areas in the southern third of Jersey City. As with earlier removals in the northern Heights, the latest realignment is unfortunate and painful for several reasons.

                                        Some of the stations had groups of regular users who are now deprived of service. And several of the stations served or are in or near, underserved communities, and neighborhoods with many lower-income residents,   which raises the serious concern that this rebalance will exacerbate the already documented

As Bike JC looks to expand upon the existing bike-lane network, we understand the need to install protected bike lanes on our busiest roads. Bike JC's vision begins with Grand Street.
